\begin{document}
\maketitle
This is the normal text we add to a \LaTeX{} file, devoid of any mathematical symbols. \\
You can also add some mathematical equations such as $3+5=8$, or some complex stuff as:
\begin{equation} [M]=e^{-\lambda t} \end{equation}
We can also change the size of fonts, and make it {\huge Big} or even very {\tiny tiny}\\
\section*{Graphs}
This is how you create a subsection in \LaTeX{}, and we have also eliminated the numbering which it provides automatically.
